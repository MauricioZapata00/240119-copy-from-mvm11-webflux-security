# Origins of this code

**This code is not mine** and is not meant to get money from it.
This code was made by [this person](https://github.com/mvm11)
and I only copy the code from this [repo](https://github.com/mvm11/webflux_security)
in order to learn about managing jwt's with Spring Webflux.

The only meaning of this is just to learn about those topics and
have a copy of it in case the previous repo shown has been removed 
or changed privacy.

Any copy of this code must be attributed to the [person](https://github.com/mvm11) 
who created.
